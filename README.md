Abstract –  Calculator Application using React 
This React Calculator Application is a simple user friendly application that allows the user to make calculations. We will use React to create the user friendly gui.
We will have all the basic operations like add, subtract, multiply, and divide. And we will also include more features than a regular calculator, we will add ways to calculate factorials,
simple derivatives, like  dx(2x^2) = 4x, and finding numbers of fibonacci sequences. So overall it's a more advanced calculator. 
4.	Goals – 
a.	Definite Goals – files, outputs, values, functionality, classes, etc… that you will have done by the end of the semester.
	Our goal by the end of the semester is to have a fully functioning application that we can run on our own computers. I don't think we will focus too much on the deployment aspect.
Our project aims to create a user-friendly calculator with some cool features. We want the calculator to look nice and be easy to use, and we're going to make sure it does math correctly in real-time.
We're also adding a memory feature so you can save numbers. You'll be able to customize the calculator's look, and we'll make sure it's accessible for everyone. Plus, we'll handle any errors, test it thoroughly, and make it work fast.
Once it's all done, we want it to be a versatile tool that helps people with different math and science tasks by the end of the semester.

b.	Future Goals – other goals that may not be feasible in the time given but would be an interesting extension from your definite goals. Some things you could accomplish if you had another semester. 
	If we had another semester, maybe we could deploy the application and make it available for many users. Which will be a much bigger task, due to the complexities of getting a domain name, using something to deploy the application, something like Azure or github. 
4.	Group Member Assignments – assign goals to specific group members. Try to be specific enough in your goals that they are easy to distribute a few to each person. These should be given as evenly as possible.
Roles: 
2 people incharge of the making GUI: Sean S, 
2 people incharge of the backend logic (calculations): Natalie Solis, 
1 Full Stack (helps overall with everything): Sishir Phuyal
